# Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt
A port of [Princess Remedy In a World of Hurt](https://remar.se/daniel/remedy.php) to modern GameMaker.

This is a fan project.
The Princess Remedy series is owned by [Remar Games](https://remar.se/daniel/) and [Ludosity](https://ludosity.com/).

This project is maintained using GameMaker LTS 2022.0.

This branch is a raw port of the original source, with minimal changes.
The only modifications, are the changes required to get the game running, and fixes for bugs introduced by the upgrade to modern GameMaker.
